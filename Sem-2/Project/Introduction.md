# INTRODUCTION TO THE PROJECT

### This is a simple SMTP Email client made in C++ using the libcurl API. This is an early project and still in development. Immprovements and features are yet to come.

This email client uses the sender's email address and the recipient's email addresses (more can be added in the code if one wants to). With the help of libcurl API, the task becomes easier to perform. There are problems in the code, encoding and security flaws are there. This will improve as more learning and experience is gained.
