# FAST-NU

### Welcome! This is the repository which stores the codes that I write for college.
This repository contains the codes for the assignments and projects that were given to me by my college. The purposes for this repsoitory are for storage and ease of access for the code, and for others who might need them as reference. However, it is mostly for storage purposes. This repository will keep being updated as long as I am in college and as long as I deem the codes to be near-perfect and usable in general.
