# INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT

## This is a Simple and Basic Chatbot Made in C

This is a porject which I picked in my first semester to learn C. In the start, I didn't enjoy C but when I started to dive more and more, I was really fascinated by the language and wanted to learn and apply more and more about it in my general use.

*This project is still in progress as it still has a lot of features to be added. Improvements in the areas of security, memory and several other areas are yet to be done. They will be implemented as time goes on.*
